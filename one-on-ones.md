# One-on-Ones

An instructor will be available every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday to do one-on-ones with students. We will schedule to have each student come and talk with us each week for around 15 minutes.

They're a safe space to talk about literally anything. One-on-Ones might include:
- Code review
- Discussing concepts covered in class
- Talking about your career search
- Thinking through project ideas
- Generally shooting the breeze

**It's up to you** what gets covered during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared!
